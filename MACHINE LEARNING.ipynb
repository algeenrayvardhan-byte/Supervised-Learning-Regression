        "\n",
        "**Answer**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple linear regression (SLR) is a statistical method used to find a linear relationship between two continuous variables. It aims to model how a dependent variable, also known as the response variable, is affected by a single independent variable, also called the explanatory or predictor variable. The model is \"simple\" because it only involves one independent variable. The goal is to create a straight line that best fits the data, which can then be used to predict future outcomes or understand the strength and direction of the relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "It assumes a linear relationship between them, represented by the equation:\n",

        "Where:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "It is primarily used for prediction and trend estimation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose**:\n",
        "\n",
        "The main purpose of SLR is to predict the value of one variable (Y) based on the known value of another variable (X) and to quantify the strength and direction of their linear relationship. It’s also used to understand how changes in X are associated with changes in Y.\n",
